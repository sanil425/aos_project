**The Breath Behind the Game** is our final project for Art of Sports.

We’re exploring how breathing shapes athletic movement — the pause before impact, the release through motion, and the rhythm that connects them. The project brings together slow-motion video, real sound, and short reflections from athletes across different sports.

Each section focuses on a single action — a tennis serve, a cricket shot, a football kick — and looks at how breath quietly drives control, power, and timing.
